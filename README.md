Automated provisioning system. Distributed, git based.

Plot
----

One day, you are tired of setup your servers and keep it
in up to date consistent state manually. You'll find
such software as Chef or Puppet, which can help you
to simplify your administrative tasks.

But sooner or later you'll find that strange DSL,
centralization and complexity doesn't make sense.

Why don't just make something simple? Configs in plain
files, simple cli interface, easy architecture.
At the same time, we can make it more stable and fault
resistant.
